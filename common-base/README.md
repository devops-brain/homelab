TODO:  add more/correct status icons (shields)


## Overview
This provides an easy setup for postgres clusters
I'm using this helm chart:  https://stackgres.io/
This one is also worth looking at for reference:  https://stackgres.io/doc/latest/install/cluster/parameters/

## Usage
Run the Jenkins job, or read it and run commands manually if you're against automation making life better  ;)
