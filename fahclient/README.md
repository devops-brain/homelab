## Overview
This is an easy container to load into k8s, with real world benefits (after all, there is a pandemic right now).
It depends on having persistent storage setup, so this project depends on the k8s deployment and the ceph deployment.  

I'm using this helm chart:  https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/pcktdmp/fahclient  
github code here:  https://github.com/pcktdmp/charts  
This one is also worth looking at for reference:  https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/brannon/folding-at-home

## Usage
Run the Jenkins job, or read it and run commands manually if you're against automation making life better  ;)
